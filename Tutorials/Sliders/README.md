#### Sliders Tutorial
This tutorial shows the key layout features of ScopeSync in relation to Sliders, as well as how to map them to parameters.

##### How to use
There's an example Modular patch in the "Modular Patch" directory. You can just load that up in Scope, browse to the preset file that's also in that directory when Scope prompts and you're then ready to load the Configuration.

Clicking on the "Open Control Panel" button of the SS128A module will open the Configuration Loader panel, where you'll be able to click on the disc icon and browse to the Sliders.configuration in this directory. If after the configuration loads the file browser opens up again, just cancel it.
