ScopeSync
=========
### Welcome to ScopeSync.
ScopeSync is a set of tools providing the following:
- High resolution control communication with the Sonic|Core Scope system via 32-bit audio
- Fully skinnable VST plugin that makes use of this communication method to allow automation of Scope parameters from any VST Host
- Scope module that shares the same XML layout definition system as the VST plugin, allowing rich user interfaces to be built for Scope devices without writing any C++, which can immediately be used in both the DAW and Scope
- BC Modular module making this same feature set available to end users building modular patches using Sonic|Core's Modular device
- Max For Live external object that exposes the ScopeSync communication method, along with a set of example Max For Live patches

Full details (work in progress!) of how to use the ScopeSync tools can be found here: [BCModular Wiki](http://bcmodular.wikispaces.com/ScopeSync)
