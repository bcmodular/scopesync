ScopeSync
=========
### Welcome to ScopeSync.
ScopeSync is a set of tools providing the following:
- High resolution communication with the Sonic|Core Scope system via 32-bit audio
- Fully skinnable VST plugin that makes use of this communication method to allow automation of Scope parameters from any VST Host
- Max For Live external object that exposes the ScopeSync communication method, along with a set of example Max For Live patches
- Scope module that allows SDK developers to share a GUI between the ScopeSync VST plugin and their device
- BC Modular module making this same feature set available to end users building modular patches using Sonic|Core's Modular device

Full details of how to use the ScopeSync tools can be found here: [BCModular Wiki](http://bcmodular.wikispaces.com/ScopeSync)
