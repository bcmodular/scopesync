ScopeSyncFX
===========
### Introduction.
This is the ScopeSync module that can be hosted within a Scope application (regular or SDK, from v4 onwards). It uses the ScopeFX library from Sonic|Core (hence the name). Note that this is Windows-only at the moment, as the Scope application itself only runs on Windows (XP onwards).

### Build information
There are builds in the /Builds directory for Visual Studio Express 2010 and Visual Studio Express 2013, but other build targets can be added in the Introjucer application using the ScopeSyncFX.jucer file if necessary. The DLL build is for 32-bit architecture, but this works fine with both 32- and 64-bit versions of Scope.
