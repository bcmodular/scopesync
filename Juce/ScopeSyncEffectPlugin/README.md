ScopeSyncPlugin
===============
### Introduction.
These are the ScopeSync modules that can be hosted within a VST-compatible Host application.

### Build information
There are builds in the /Builds directory for Visual Studio Express 2010 and Visual Studio Express 2013, but other build targets can be added in the Introjucer application using the ScopeSyncFX.jucer file if necessary. There is a 32-bit Debug target for each and Release targets for 32- and 64-bit architectures.

#### Debugging
Juce's "audio plugin host" (found in JUCE/extras) is pretty good for debugging VSTs during the build cycle.
