ScopeSync - Juce
=================
### Introduction.
This is the Juce-based version of ScopeSync, comprising of two DLLs: ScopeSyncVST.dll (Visual Studio projects and source in /ScopeSyncPlugin) and ScopeSync.dll (Visual Studio  projects and source in /ScopeSyncFX). The first of these is a plugin for VST hosts and the second is a module for the Sonic|Core Scope system.

Most of the code is found in /ScopeSyncShared, as the two modules share the majority of the feature set.
