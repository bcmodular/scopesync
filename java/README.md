### ScopeSync mxj~ object
This directory contains the source code for the ScopeSync mxj~ object used within the example Max For Live patches to handle ScopeSync communication between Max For Live and Scope.

### Build notes
Eclipse is a pretty good option for doing a build, if you want to have a go. The most important setting you'll need in your project is to add the Max .jar library to the classpath. This is installed as part of the Max For Live setup and for the 32bit install is found here:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Cycling '74\Max 6.1\Cycling '74\java\lib\max.jar
```
