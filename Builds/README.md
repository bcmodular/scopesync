ScopeSync - Builds
==================
### Introduction.
Contained in this folder are all of the various .jucer files that can generate Visual Studio and XCode builds by using Projucer (part of Roli's Juce).
These allow you to build the various ScopeSync modules, including the ScopeSDK DLL (known as ScopeFX), VST/AU plugins and standalone executables for Windows + Mac.

### Build information
Load any of the .jucer files in the Projucer and click Save. This will create the relevant solution/project files for Visual Studio or XCode, which can then be loaded
and built
