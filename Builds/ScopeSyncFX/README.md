ScopeSyncFX
===========
### Introduction.
This is the ScopeSync module that can be hosted within a Scope application (regular or SDK, from v4 onwards). It uses the ScopeFX library from Sonic|Core (hence the name). Note that this is Windows-only at the moment, as the Scope application itself only runs on Windows (XP onwards).

### Build information
The ScopeSyncFX.jucer file for Projucer will create Visual Studio 2013 and 2017 builds. The VS2017 build should be preferred as Juce will be discontinuing support for VS2013 soon. The DLL build is for 32-bit architecture, but this works fine with both 32- and 64-bit versions of Scope.
